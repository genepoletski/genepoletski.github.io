## Why and what

Having worked on React and React Native projects, I noticed that some dissatisfaction with what and how I did never completely fades away. We released the projects. New people with good new ideas joined and left. We tried many libraries and patterns. We had an awesome time smashing various problems. But itch for a better* and different** way of doing stuff is so hard to ignore. Hopefully, it explains <b>why</b>.

What I am going to do is to build a project from scratch (yeah, one more BIG RIGHT THING). My vision of <b>what</b>:
- It is a simple app
- The app has an Android version
- The app has an iOS version
- The app has a Web version
- It is built as React Native first
- It is a monorepo

Nothing unusual, and because you are reading this, you probably already know that there are dozens, if not hundreds or thousands, of similar posts and articles. Will it be any different and more useful for you this time? Let's see. I hope so.
